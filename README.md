# tanmaymit-Delivery-Duration-Prediction
This project aims to build a predictive model for estimating the total delivery duration of orders placed on DoorDash. The model predicts the time taken from the moment a consumer places an order to when it is delivered. Accurate predictions are crucial for enhancing customer experience and optimizing delivery operations.
